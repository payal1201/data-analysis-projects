## Insights & Recommendations:

### Key Insights:

    Orders grew significantly from 2016 (329) to 2018 (54,011) — showing strong e-commerce expansion.

    Customers are spread across 27 states and 4,119 cities, with São Paulo (SP) leading in both orders and revenue.

    Peak order periods occurred in Nov 2017 and Jan 2018, suggesting seasonality around festive and new year periods.

    Most orders are placed in the afternoon (1 PM–6 PM), followed by night hours — key times for digital engagement.

    SP and RJ are top contributors to total and freight revenue, while RR and AP show low activity and potential for expansion.

    Credit cards are the most preferred payment method, while 7-month installment plans are most common.

    Freight costs and delivery times vary widely by state; RR shows the highest average delivery time, while AC delivers fastest.

### Recommendations:

    Scale Operations: Strengthen logistics and customer support to sustain rapid order growth.

    Seasonal Campaigns: Focus promotions around peak months (Nov–Jan) and high-activity hours (Afternoon/Night).

    Regional Focus:

    Prioritize SP and RJ for retention and premium campaigns.

    Expand outreach in low-performing states (RR, AP) with localized offers and partnerships.

    Optimize Logistics: Analyze and replicate efficient delivery practices from AC and RO in slower states.

    Payment Strategy: Promote credit card and popular installment options with loyalty rewards to boost transactions.

    Customer Experience: Use dashboards to visualize spending, monitor delays, and tailor marketing to key demographics.
