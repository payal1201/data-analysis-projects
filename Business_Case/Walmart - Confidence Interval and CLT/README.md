## Project Objective:
To analyze customer purchasing patterns and spending behavior across demographics such as gender and age, enabling Walmart’s management team to make data-driven marketing and inventory decisions.

### Key Goal — 

  The company aims to identify significant factors influencing purchase amounts, particularly gender and age, to answer key questions such as:

  Do spending habits differ between male and female customers during major sales like Black Friday?

  Which demographic segments contribute the most to revenue?

## Insights & Recommendations:

  Male customers spend slightly more on average, but gender differences are not statistically significant due to overlapping confidence intervals.

  Age group 26–45 represents the highest-spending segment, while 0–17 and 55+ show lower spending.

  Male customers show greater variation in purchase behavior, offering opportunities for high-value targeting.

## Recommended actions include:

  Launch gender- and age-specific promotional campaigns.

  Personalize recommendations based on prior purchases filtered by demographic factors.

  Prioritize marketing and inventory for the 26–45 age segment during major sales.

  Use visual dashboards for gender-age spending insights to support data-driven marketing and stocking decisions.
